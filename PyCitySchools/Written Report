Going over this data it shows that a schools budget doesn't necessarily impact students scores or learning, but it may play a part.
In fact, the driving factors behind higher scores seems to be smaller schools.
This likely results in smaller class sizes and more teacher to student communication.
It also seems that charter schools have higher overall scores compared to districts.
It can also be said that when narrowed down to per student spending,
it seems like lower spending actually results in higher scores.
However, we'd need more datasets to prove that any of these conclusions are causes of higher scores not just correlations.
